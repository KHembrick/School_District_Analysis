# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The Overview of this project is to Analyze standardized school test data, to identify performance trends and patterns. 

### Purpose
  * Upon completing the analysis. The school board has evidence and suspects that the reading and math scores for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to be altered. Due to       there being evidence of acedemic dishonesty. I was tasked with replacing the ninth graders reading and math scores and re-run the original analysis and report and describe any     changes that affected the overall analysis.
    
## Results
### How was the district summary affected:
As per the chart below there was no change in the district summary.

### How was the the school summary affected:
  * The changes that were made did not have a big impact on the school district analysis. There is a total student count of 39,170, and out of the total number of students there     are only 461 ninth graders. Ninth graders only make up 1.2% of the number of students total. as shown in the chart below.

The Charter School changed in all areas by less than 1%. The district averages an passing percentages did not change at all due to Thomas High School is not apart of the district.

## Summary
In conclusion there were very slight changes in the reading and math scores. However there was not a significant change or impact to the district scores or percentages. The changes overall in replacing the ninth grade reading and math test scores is less than 1%. What i believe would have made a bigger difference is if we would have changed the ninth grade scores to 0 then re-run the School district analysis again.
